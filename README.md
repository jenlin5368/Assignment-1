3. I did my analysis on the app but here is the link to the website- https://runkeeper.com/

App Description:  
The purpose of the app is to keep track of a user's distance, time, pace and location while they are running. They also provide features where a person can keep track of their improvement, connect with other runners and create goals for themselves. They are helping to keep people accountable and motivate people to live a healthier lifestyle.   
Overall Evaluation:  
I've used this app before and I think this app serves its purpose and function, but I think that the interfaces are too crowded. Their target users are runners and they may be using this app while moving or with exhaustion so it needs to be made simpler. They have a lot of features crammed on each page and I think they should be more spread out into different tabs. I also think some things are hard to find on the app.

4. Heuristic Evaluations  
#1: Visibility of system status  
Runkeeper shows feedback everytime a user presses a button by darkening the color of the button and indicates where a user is on the navigation bar with a  blue color. The app also shows button feedback by immediately navigating to the new page. For the tracking feature, they have audio that states when a user starts, pauses or resumes the app to help the user be aware which button they pressed. The only loading icon they had was when you create a goal, it has a loading clock to show that it is creating your goal.

#2: Match between system and the real world  
I think the app could improve in this section. They use terms that are unclear to new users like "Free Run", "My First 5K" and "Feed". Also, some of the terms they use are understandable, but vague in describing the function. They also use a lot of icons to represent the functions of their buttons and some of the symbols are unclear. For example, the profile button is a smiley face instead of the usual icon and it is called "Me".   
Severity Rating: 2  
Unclear Terms:

#3: User control and freedom  
A user has a lot of options to cancel their actions. When a user wants to end their run or they want to delete a run, the app asks the user again to click another button to make sure they are sure of their decision.  
Severity Rating: 0

#4: Consistency and standards  
They are consistent with their fonts and colors. However, some of their icons are ambiguous in meaning and they have have two setting buttons, two speech bubble buttons, two add friend buttons and two hamburger icons used for different purposes. This conduses the user of what the function is for each button. Their chart for the profile also uses colors that make it look like they are clickable buttons, but they are not. They also have a place where you can accept challenges and when you accept a challenge it looks like a button when it isn't a button.  
Severity Rating: 2  
Misleading Looking Button:

#5: Error prevention  
To prevent the error of actually ending a run, they pop up another screen that asks the users if they meant to press that button. This prevents accidental button pushes from happening.  
Severity Rating:  
#6: Recognition rather than recall  
They keep track of users past runs and times, so users don't have to remember if they improved or not.  
Severity Rating:  
#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
This app is very flexible for other exercise methodologies or with keeping track of other forms of fitness. This is mostly just for cardio. The app is also not very efficient for both novice or expert users as the user interface is too busy.  
Severity Rating: 1  
#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design  
I think this app suffers mostly in this category. It has too much happening on each page. Some features should be put elsewhere and more hidden especially if they aren't commonly used features. If a user is running, they need a simple and large button interface to use while they are moving. They also have too many options and buttons that slow down and confuse the user when they are using the app.They have two add friend options.  
Severity Rating: 3  
#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  
Runkeeper doesn't really provide error messages. Most likely since it is an app, it would close automatically and restart the app. This doesn't help the user with what went wrong.  
Severity Rating: 1  
#10: Help and documentation  
Runkeeper doesn't have a help section. They don't explain how to use the app or have any instructions.
Severity Rating:  

Overall Fixes and Priorities:  
Since UX designers only have so much time, they have to start with the biggest issues to fix. I think the first issue sohuld be....
