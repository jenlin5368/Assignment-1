3. I did my analysis for the Runkeeper app but here is the link to the website https://runkeeper.com/   
This is the logo and homepage screen:

**App Description:**  
The purpose of the app is to keep track of a user's distance, time, pace and location while they are running. They also provide features where a person can keep track of their improvement, connect with other runners and create goals for themselves. This app is helping to keep people accountable and motivating people to live a healthier lifestyle thorugh cardio.  
**Overall Evaluation:**  
I've used this app before and I think that it serves its purpose and function. However, I think that the interfaces are too crowded with too many buttons and text on each screen. Their target users are runners that may be using this app while moving so it needs to have a simpler interface with only important buttons. With too many features, more important features are harder to find on the app or take longer as there are more buttons to navigate through. Some of the icons and wordings are also confusing and inconsistent.

4. Heuristic Evaluations  
**#1: Visibility of system status**, Severity Rating: 0    
Runkeeper shows feedback everytime a user presses a button by darkening the color of the button and immediately navigating to the new page. They also indicate where a user is on the navigation bar with a bright blue color. For the tracking feature, they have audio that states when a user starts, pauses or resumes the app to help the user be aware which button they pressed. They also have a a loading clock to show that things are loading. Overall, the user is never confused or unaware if their action was processed or not.  
**Loading Symbol:**

**Blue Icon Navigation Bar:**

**#2: Match between system and the real world**, Severity Rating: 2  
I think the app could improve in this section. They use terms that are unclear and vague to new users like "Free Run", "My First 5K" and "Feed". There are better ways to explain and simplify these wordings. Also, some of the other terms they use are understandable, but vague in describing the function. They also use a lot of icons to represent the functions of their buttons and some of the symbols are unclear. To be more explicit they add wording next to each icon which makes the screen look too  busy.  
**Unclear Terms:**

**#3: User control and freedom**, Severity Rating: 1  
A user has a lot of options to cancel their accidental actions. When a user wants to end their run or  want to delete a run, the app asks the user again to click another button to make sure they are sure of their decision. However, one thing I couldn't figure out was how to cancel a challenge after I have accepted it. I was frusterated with not being able to go back on the challenge acceptance.   
**Cancel Buttons:**

**#4: Consistency and standards**, Severity Rating: 3   
They are consistent with their fonts and colors. However, some of their icons are ambiguous in meaning and they have have two setting buttons, two speech bubble buttons, two add friend buttons and two hamburger icons used for different purposes. This confuses the user of what the function is for each button. They also use an unconventional profile symbol and call it the "Me" section. Their chart for the profile section also uses colors that make it look like they are clickable buttons, but they are not. They also have a place where you can accept challenges and when you accept a challenge it looks like a pressable button when it isn't a button. When it is not consistent, it makes users confused and press wrong buttons.  
**Misleading Challenge Button:**

**Hamburger Icon with one function:**

**Hamburger Icon with a different function:**

**#5: Error prevention**, Severity Rating: 0   
To prevent a common error like accidentlly pressing the end run button, another button pops up to ask the users if they meant to press that button. This prevents accidental button pushes from occuring. They also make users fill out all fields of a running entry to ensure that there are not empty running logs.   
**Running Log:**

**#6: Recognition rather than recall**, Severity Rating: 0  
This app automatically keeps track of users past runs and times, so users don't have to remember what their best times are and if they improved or not. For manual running entries they also provide specific information to fill in so users don't have to think of what they need to write down.  
**Past Runs:**

**#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**, Severity Rating: 1  
This app is not flexible for keeping track of other exercise methodologies or with keeping track of other forms of fitness. This app is just for cardio. The app is also not able to personalize for a novice vs. expert user. It is also not efficient for users to use as the user interface is too busy and requires a lot of button pushing.    
**#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**, Severity Rating: 3  
I think this app suffers most in this category as too much is happening on each page. Some features should not be put on a main screen if they aren't commonly used features. If a user is running, they need a simple and large buttoned interface to make it easier to press a button while running. With too many options and buttons, it also slows down and confuses the user when they are using the app the first time. They also have too much text for each symbol.  
**Busy Profile Page:**

**#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**, Severity Rating: 1    
Runkeeper doesn't really provide error messages. I haven't faced any errors yet, but I assume since it is an app that it would close automatically and restart the app from the home page without any error messages. This doesn't help tell the user what is wrong though.   
**#10: Help and documentation**, Severity Rating: 1  
Runkeeper also doesn't have a help or tutorial section. They don't explain how to use the app or have any instructions, so users have to figure it out themselves.  

**Overall Fixes and Priorities:**    
UX designers are limited time and can only work on a few issues at a time. Thus they need to learn to prioritize the most severe problems. In this case I think the top priority would be fixing Aesthetic and Minimalist Design or Consistency and Standards. Runkeeper has the most issues with these two categories. These issues make it harder for the user to use the app and navigate through. They may not know where to find certain featuers or may accidentally press incorrect buttons. This can cause users to be frusterated or overwhelmed and desire to use a different app. The other less severe qualities are more like nice to have features, but not a necessity. They are also not noticeable to a novice user while the severe issues are obvious from the first moment a user opens the app.
