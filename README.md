App Description and Evaluation:  
The purpose of the app is to keep track of a user's running distance, pace and location while they are running. It also helps a person keep track of all the runs they do, connect with other runners in the world and create goals for themselves.

They have a lot of features crammed on each page and I think they should be more spread out into different tabs. I also think the app can be hard to use sometimes as it is hard to find some features of the app.
